  - 'Oh welcome kid! So you want to become a water cycle expert? '
  - 'You are at the right place! '
  - I will teach you the basics.
  - We are going to have five lessons here.
  - After each lesson, I will send you into a simulation where you will play as the
    Water Spirit to deepen your understanding while having fun.
  - Your mission will be to defeat the threats endangering the water cycle and help
    people preserve their water resources! Now let's start our first lesson!
  - "Today, we\u2019ll learn about water and why it\u2019s so important. Water isn\u2019t
    just for drinking\u2014it keeps plants, animals, and the whole planet alive.
    But in many places, especially in villages, pollution is making water unsafe."
  - "Let\u2019s explore this together!\r\nDid you know that pollution in villages
    can come from things like: Farming chemicals (like fertilizers and pesticides)
    that get washed into rivers and lakes. Trash and waste being thrown into water
    sources.\r\n"
  - "Factories dumping harmful chemicals into streams. These things make the water
    dirty, which can harm plants, animals, and people. It\u2019s up to us to protect
    it!"
  - "We need to build a conscience! If this goes on we won't be able to find water
    anymore! But we are lucky to have youngsters like you here! Also, Let me tell
    you some fun facts about water! Water covers about 70% of the Earth\u2019s surface,
    but most of it is salty and in oceans."
  - "Only a tiny amount of water is fresh and safe for drinking\u2014about 1% of
    all the water on Earth! Also, Water changes form, it can be a liquid, a solid
    (like ice), or a gas (like steam). Cool, right? For now we can conclude our lesson!
    Thanks for your attention!"
  - Are you ready to save the world now???!
