  - Welcome back, kid!
  - 'Our next mission takes you to a beautiful forest under threat.

'
  - Forests play a critical role in the water cycle. Trees absorb water from the
    soil through their roots and release it into the atmosphere as water vapor through
    a process called transpiration.
  - When trees are cut down, this process slows down or stops, reducing the amount
    of water vapor in the air and disrupting the formation of clouds and rainfall.
  - Deforestation also increases soil erosion, making it harder for the ground to
    retain water. Without trees, more water runs off the surface instead of soaking
    into the soil, leading to flooding or droughts in nearby areas.
  - 'Now you understand why preserving forests is vital for the water cycle and the
    health of our planet! Are you ready for the next simulation?
